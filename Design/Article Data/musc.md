# MUSBUIL

### 1. Introduction 
Building lean muscle mass is a goal held by many fitness enthusiasts and athletes. Whether you want to build a sculpted body or improve your performance in sports and activities, understanding the principles of effective muscle building is important. In these article we will explore the key factors that contribute to muscle growth inside, offering practical insights and actionable tips to help you achieve your goals. From the best training methods and nutritional strategies, I will guide you on a journey to provide you great muscle-building power and unlock the potential within. 


### 2. Fundamentals
There are three requirements to adding muscle mass optimally - nutrition, training, and recovery. 

Nutrition is the easiest to understand and hardest to implement. In simple terms, just eat more. But there's more to it than just "eat more" which we discuss later. The jist of it is that one must keep themselves in a slight caloric surplus - consuming more calories than they expend - and keeping their protein intake high. 

Muscles grow when one continuosly challenges them with high mechanical tension over a significant period of time. Muscle hypertrophy occurs when protein synthesis muscle protien breakdown and results in positive net protein balance in cumulative periods. This can be achieved with resistance training and protein ingestion, which stimulate muscle protein synthesis [1] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/#:~:text=Muscle%20hypertrophy%20occurs%20when%20muscle,muscle%20protein%20breakdown%20%5B8%5D.]

Recovery is the most overlooked aspect of muscle building, and of fitness in general. You can follow the most optimal workout regime and have an amazing diet, but if your recovery is terrible (if you are not sleeping enough, for example), you can kiss your gains goodbye.


### 3. Nutrition
As previously mentioned, adding muscle from a nutritional point of view is simply to eat more and eat enough protein. Now lets discuss these points in detail.

"Eat more" is easy to say, but how much more? First off, you'll need to know know your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). This is the amount of calories you need for your daily life, which is the sum of calories burned at absolute rest plus the calories burned from any sort of physical activity (even fidgeting with a toy when bored counts, even though it's not a significant amount). Simply search for a TDEE calculator on Google and fill out the details like your height, weight and activity levels (even though I'm not exactly a fan of how activity levels are input in these calculators; because apparently exercising twice per week and exercising 4 times a week consumes different amount per day). Now select the calorie count labeled "maintainance". This is the amount of calories you can eat without any changes in your weight. To add muscle mass, simply consume 200-300 calories more than your maintaince as step one.

A thing to note is that these numbers are estimates at the end of the day and not completely accurate. Something I do is average the numbers from different TDEE calculators. Ultimately, your weight and body composition is what confirms your true maintainance. If you gain too much weight too quickly, reduce your calorie count. 

Consuming the optimal amount of protein is just as important as eating enough calories. Protein is what your muscles are ultimately composed of, so common sense suggests we eat more protein to build more muscle. Of course, you need other macronutrients like carbohydrates and fats, as well as micronutrients for optimal body functioning so not everything you eat has to be protein and protein only. If you only ate a theoretical protein source that was 100% protein, you won't become the next Ronnie Colemann - you'd be dead.

Ideally, one should be consuming 0.8 - 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (1.76 to 2.20 g per kg for the rest of the world). Some sources say it's per pound of 'lean' bodyweight (excluding fat and water weight), but honestly, consuming more protein is not going to harm you unless your doctor has advised you not to for some reason. The rest of your macro split doesnt matter much. It can be low carb high fat, or high carb low fat, or whatever. Both of them are energy sources in the end, and having pinpoint accurate carb-fat splits are a concern for the top athletes, not the average individual. An athlete may choose carbs (majorly composed of sugars) for quick energy, for example.

To recap, eat 200-300 calories above maintainance, and eat 0.8 - 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (1.76 to 2.20 g per kg) for optimal muscle growth. 

One thing to be aware of - when we say calories when talking about food, we refer to the unit Kilocalories (kcal) as seen in food labels. i suppose it's for ease of communication. 1 kcal is 1000 calories and 1 calorie is a small unit of energy as far as food is concerned. Any reference to "calories" when talking about food is talking about "kcal". 


### 4. Eat "more"
Eating more is easy for people like me, but it's not for a lot of people. It could be due to a naturally small appetite or the types of food you eat. Seems like the perfect place to discuss calorie density of foods.

Simply put, calorie density is the number of calories per unit mass of food. Fun fact: Uranium-235 will give you apporximately 34.5 billion kcal per gram if you could digest it :). 

The easiest way to increase your calorie intake is to consume calorie dense foods. To give an example, 100g of raw blueberries gives you an approximate 57 calories. [2] [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/blueberries#nutrition], while just 30g of the brand of peanut butter I use is 183 calories. Choosing the peanut butter, in this case, will give you more calories even in smaller quantities, letting you hit your surplus easily.

One way to really know about your consumption is to track your calories. If you can do it, amazing. If you cannot maintain this for the rest of your life, I recommend doing it for 3-4 days with the foods you frequently eat just so you know and can make decisions on what you want to eat to meet your goals. In my experience, even a few days of tracking calories makes you more aware of the things you eat and whether you want to eat them or not.

### 5. Bodyweight
Bodyweight can be divided into 4 parts - muscle mass, fat mass, water weight, and constant weight

Muscle mass is, well, muscle mass

Fat mass increases when body has excess energy. The body utilises energy from glucose in the bloodstream. Any excess energy is stored as Glycogen for use when needed. Any excess is then stored as fat.

Water makes up about 60% of the human body (some books say 70%, some other sources say 65%, I say, it's a lot). Any 'extra' water being held is "water weight", which can be seem as puffy body parts. Some reasons for excess water retention are high intake of sodium (through salt and other sources) and a very high amount of carbohydrates consumption (maybe you are eating too many sandwiches?). In extreme cases, it could be caused due to kidney diseases. [3] [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320603#prevention]

Constant mass is what you cannot change for the most part. It includes mass of your bones, organs, body fluids, etc.

Our goal in muscle building is to, well, build muscle. Staying in a caloric surplus will inevitably add fat as well, provided your protein consumption, training and recovery is on point. What we can do is try are best to minimise the fat gained. An easy way to do it is to follow the previous strategy: 200-300 calories above maintainance and protein consumption 0.8 - 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (1.76 to 2.20 g per kg). While this method will take longer to put on the same amount of muscle than a "dirty bulk", but it ensures you build the most amount of muscle while gaining the least amount of fat possible, so you don't have to go on a "cut" later on. 


### 6. Training
Assuming your nutrition is on point, we now talk about how to train for building muscle. And to be honest, it's not that complicated. 

First things first, you need a split that distributes the muscles you work in a way that you target one muscle group twice a week ideally. This ensures you are providing growth stimulus for your muscles optimally.

Do not eat at least 90 minutes before your workout to avoid feeling sick and puking all over the floor.

Ensure that you warm up before yourworkout routine. Some light work to get blood pumping is a good way to ensure less chances of injuries.

As for the workout itself, you must make sure that you try to push yourself harder than previous sessions. The keyword is "try". You may get a few extra reps than last time, you may not, but ultimately, you pushed yourself to go harder than before and that's all good. In formal terms, this is Progressive Overload. Say you perfomed bench press with 60kg weight for 10 repetitions; try to go for 11 or 12 next time you hit the bench. If you can comfortably do 20 reps with that weigth, try 65kg next. Constantly pushing yourself is the best way to stimulate muscle growth.

Exercise selection plays an important role in how quick you notice your "gains" but it is also not something you need to dive into detail and give up because there's too much information. Some simple ways to select good exercises are to avoid the "Do this to get big" or "I got a crazy pump with this ONE exercise" videos on social media. Most of them are just there to get views and to look cool. Stick to the basic exercises. Include must do compound movements like bench press, shoulder press, squats, deadlifts and pull-ups. They can be replaced with their different variants as long as the movement is the same. So you can do push-ups instead of bench press, or lat pulldown instead of pull-ups. 

I feel weird shoulder problems when performing a strict bench press, hence I rearely do them. Instead I prefer push-ups or dumbbell press as I have better control in these movements and my shoulder-joint doesnt make the "clicking sounds" like you do when cracking knuckles.

Begin your session with the compound movements corresponding to the split and end with isolation movements as compound movements involve multiple muscle groups and can be pretty tiring if done in the end of your session. 

Keeping all this in mind, here's a typical pull-workout for me: pulldowns (I'm not strong enough for pullups), deadlifts, rows, rear-delt flyes, a drop set with a mix of bicep curls in the bginming and hammer curls by the end, and some forearm work because they are lacking right now. Notice how I've organised them. Pulldowns will target my lats and a major portion of upper back. Deadlifts for the lower back and general strength while my upper back can recover for the rows. Rear delt flyes to get the burn in my rear delts, then finish with biceps and forearms. Taking the time to organise your exercises will help you get the most out of your workout. 

Also, there is no such thing as weighlifting better than calisthenics for muscle building. It's more like weightlifting is more convenient to build muscle with. Your muscles understand mechanical tension and cannot distinguish between tension from machines, weights or bodyweight. If you do take the calisthenics route, you'll just have to be creative with how you progressively overload. If squats are too easy, do pistol squats. If push-ups are too easy, do planche push-ups or archer push-ups. It's all up to you, really.


### 7. Split
Your workout split is just as important as execise selection. You can have the best workout of your life today, but if you dont let the muscles recover, your next workout of the same group will be garbage. 

As mentioned previously, you should ideally be looking to hit every muscle group twice a week. How you split them is upto you depending on the time you have. If you can only workout for 3-4 days per week, you need to work with that. If you can do 5-6 days, you have a lot more time to focus on finer details. I wouldn't recommend going all 7 days. Rest days are just as important as your training days.

Here are some example splits I use/have used depending on time constraints

4 days: Upper Body | Rest | Lower Body | Rest | Upper Body | Rest | Lower Body (and it  cycles)

5 days (my current): Upper Body Push + Quads + Calves | Upper Body Pull + Hamstrings | Rest | Full Legs | Upper Body Push | Upper Body Pull | Rest (and it  cycles)

Notice how each muscle group has ample time to recover and is being hit twice a week. If you want to look at finer details, notcie how I have enough recovery time between Pull and Legs movement which allows me to perform Conventional Deadlifts and Romanian Deadlifts while making sure they recover. Deadlifts as a movement targets your lower back, glutes and hamstrings primarily. With my 5 day plan, I can hit Conventional Deadlifts on Upper Body Pull + Hamstrings and then do Romanian Deadlifts on Leg day without having to worry about recovery.

The split should be made as per the time you have available. It is not mandatory for you to celebrate Internation Chest Day on Mondays.


### 8. Recovery
Recovery plays a role in muscle building, just as much as proper eating and training. A younger me was hitting biceps only everyday wondering why I never got bigger arms. Do not do this.

Recovery period is when your body repairs the damage done to muscle fibers during exercise. The muscles get bigger and stronger over time to keep up with future demands. The opposite is also true - a long period of sedentary lifestyle will lead to muscle loss (and strength as well). Let's not focus on that part for now. Here are some ways to ensure good recovery.

Make sure your workout split gives you enough time to recover per muscle group.

Having proper sleep is one of the biggest parts of recovery. TL;DR - A good quality sleep will help your muscles recover quicker and get bigger and stronger. How long you sleep is upto you. If you need 9 hours of sleep, you need 9 hours of sleep. If you are completely refreshed in 5 hours of sleep, that's for you. Do not go with the "everyone needs 6-8 hours of sleep". Sleep for as long as your body needs it.

If cold showers, ice baths ad such help you with muscle soreness and recovery, then by all means do them. Just make sure with a doctor that you do not have certain health conditions where taking super cold baths can be fatal.
