# MUSBUIL

### 1. Introduction 
Building lean muscle mass is a goal held by many fitness enthusiasts and athletes. Whether you want to build a sculpted body or improve your performance in sports and activities, understanding the principles of effective muscle building is important. In these article we will explore the key factors that contribute to muscle growth inside, offering practical insights and actionable tips to help you achieve your goals. From the best training methods and nutritional strategies, I will guide you on a journey to provide you great muscle-building power and unlock the potential within. 


### 2. Fundamentals
There are three requirements to adding muscle mass optimally - nutrition, training, and recovery. 

Nutrition is the easiest to understand and hardest to implement. In simple terms, just eat more. But there's more to it than just "eat more" which we discuss later. The jist of it is that one must keep themselves in a slight caloric surplus - consuming more calories than they expend - and keeping their protein intake high. 

Muscles grow when one continuosly challenges them with high mechanical tension over a significant period of time. Muscle hypertrophy occurs when protein synthesis muscle protien breakdown and results in positive net protein balance in cumulative periods. This can be achieved with resistance training and protein ingestion, which stimulate muscle protein synthesis [1] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/#:~:text=Muscle%20hypertrophy%20occurs%20when%20muscle,muscle%20protein%20breakdown%20%5B8%5D.]

Recovery is the most overlooked aspect of muscle building, and of fitness in general. You can follow the most optimal workout regime and have an amazing diet, but if your recovery is terrible (if you are not sleeping enough, for example), you can kiss your gains goodbye.


### 3. Nutrition Basics
As previously mentioned, adding muscle from a nutritional point of view is simply to eat more and eat enough protein. Now lets discuss these points in detail.

"Eat more" is easy to say, but how much more? First off, you'll need to know know your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). This is the amount of calories you need for your daily life, which is the sum of calories burned at absolute rest plus the calories burned from any sort of physical activity (even fidgeting with a toy when bored counts, even though it's not a significant amount). Simply search for a TDEE calculator on Google and fill out the details like your height, weight and activity levels (even though I'm not exactly a fan of how activity levels are input in these calculators; because apparently exercising twice per week and exercising 4 times a week consumes different amount per day). Now select the calorie count labeled "maintainance". This is the amount of calories you can eat without any changes in your weight. To add muscle mass, simply consume 200-300 calories more than your maintaince as step one.

A thing to note is that these numbers are estimates at the end of the day and not completely accurate. Something I do is average the numbers from different TDEE calculators. Ultimately, your weight and body composition is what confirms your true maintainance. If you gain too much weight too quickly, reduce your calorie count. 

Consuming the optimal amount of protein is just as important as eating enough calories. Protein is what your muscles are ultimately composed of, so common sense suggests we eat more protein to build more muscle. Of course, you need other macronutrients like carbohydrates and fats, as well as micronutrients for optimal body functioning so not everything you eat has to be protein and protein only. If you only ate a theoretical protein source that was 100% protein, you won't become the next Ronnie Colemann - you'd be dead.

Ideally, one should be consuming 0.8 - 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (1.76 to 2.20 g per kg for the rest of the world). Some sources say it's per pound of 'lean' bodyweight (excluding fat and water weight), but honestly, consuming more protein is not going to harm you unless your doctor has advised you not to for some reason. The rest of your macro split doesnt matter much. It can be low carb high fat, or high carb low fat, or whatever. Both of them are energy sources in the end, and having pinpoint accurate carb-fat splits are a concern for the top athletes, not the average individual. An athlete may choose carbs (majorly composed of sugars) for quick energy, for example.

To recap, eat 200-300 calories above maintainance, and eat 0.8 - 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (1.76 to 2.20 g per kg) for optimal muscle growth. 

One thing to be aware of - when we say calories when talking about food, we refer to the unit Kilocalories (kcal) as seen in food labels. i suppose it's for ease of communication. 1 kcal is 1000 calories and 1 calorie is a small unit of energy as far as food is concerned. Any reference to "calories" when talking about food is talking about "kcal". 


### 4. Eating "more"
Eating more is easy for people like me, but it's not for a lot of people. It could be due to a naturally small appetite or the types of food you eat. Seems like the perfect place to discuss calorie density of foods.

Simply put, calorie density is the number of calories per unit mass of food. Fun fact: Uranium-235 will give you apporximately 34.5 billion kcal per gram if you could digest it :). 

The easiest way to increase your calorie intake is to consume calorie dense foods. To give an example, 100g of raw blueberries gives you an approximate 57 calories. [2] [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/blueberries#nutrition], while just 30g of the brand of peanut butter I use is 183 calories. Choosing the peanut butter, in this case, will give you more calories even in smaller quantities, letting you hit your surplus easily.

One way to really know about your consumption is to track your calories. If you can do it, amazing. If you cannot maintain this for the rest of your life, I recommend doing it for 3-4 days with the foods you frequently eat just so you know and can make decisions on what you want to eat to meet your goals. In my experience, even a few days of tracking calories makes you more aware of the things you eat and whether you want to eat them or not.

### 5. Bodyweight
Bodyweight can be divided into 4 parts - muscle mass, fat mass, water weight, and constant weight

Muscle mass is, well, muscle mass

Fat mass increases when body has excess energy. The body utilises energy from glucose in the bloodstream. Any excess energy is stored as Glycogen for use when needed. Any excess is then stored as fat.

Water makes up about 60% of the human body (some books say 70%, some other sources say 65%, I say, it's a lot). Any 'extra' water being held is "water weight", which can be seem as puffy body parts. Some reasons for excess water retention are high intake of sodium (through salt and other sources) and a very high amount of carbohydrates consumption (maybe you are eating too many sandwiches?). In extreme cases, it could be caused due to kidney diseases. [3] [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320603#prevention]

Constant mass is what you cannot change for the most part. It includes mass of your bones, organs, body fluids, etc.

Our goal in muscle building is to, well, build muscle. Staying in a caloric surplus will inevitably add fat as well, provided your protein consumption, training and recovery is on point. What we can do is try are best to minimise the fat gained. An easy way to do it is to follow the previous strategy: 200-300 calories above maintainance and protein consumption 0.8 - 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (1.76 to 2.20 g per kg). While this method will take longer to put on the same amount of muscle than a "dirty bulk", but it ensures you build the most amount of muscle while gaining the least amount of fat possible, so you don't have to go on a "cut" later on. 


### 6. Training
Assuming your nutrition is on point, we now talk about how to train for building muscle. And to be honest, it's not that complicated.
