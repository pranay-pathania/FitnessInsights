### 1. Supplements
This is a BIG topic. And the one with the most confusion and/or misinformation. So it's time to clear some basics.

Do you NEED supplements to attain your goals? No. Do they make it easier for you to attain your goals? YES! 

Starting of with the most popular one, Whey Protein (or any protein powder, really). It is just your regular food sources in a powder form, which are high in protein and have little to no carbs or fats (in case of whey, it's milk). Protein powders are just a convenient way of increasing your protein consumption without any extra macros to mess you up, especially if you follow a particular dietary lifestyle like keto. That's it. It is not something magical you absolutely must have or else you'll never build muscle.

Continuing the whole protein powder topic, there's something to consider when making your own. If protein is not the highest in percentage by weight, it is not a protein powder. There's a lot of videos on social media that claim to make protein powders/protein shakes at home without the store-bought powder which typically includes a whole lot of dry fruits like almonds, cashew, etc. or a lot of bananas and peanut butter. Looking at their macros shows that they are higher in carbs or fats than in protein. Sure, you'll get the protein, but at the cost of a whole lot of extra calories - which may be great on a dirty bulk, but definitely not when you are on a cut or want to fine tune your calorie consumption.

### 2. Creatine
Another popular supplement is Creatine. Your body creates some of it's own creatine, and it is found in some foods, but the quatities are small and your muscles will not get to full saturation. Creatine helps with ATP production, which helps with upping your workout intensity; it hydrates your muscle cells and can be used by your body as a fuel source.

The most popular choice of creatine supplement is Creatine Monohydrate. It is well researched and has various proven benefits. There are many other variants, but they are relatively new, not researched enough, and used as a marketing gimmick more than something that's supposed to be better than monohydrate. Creatine Monohydrate is the cheapest and the most effective, hence giving the most bang for your buck.

Creatine is a saturation supplement. Some people prefer a loading phase, where they take about 20g per day for a week or so till their muscles reach complete saturation, then lower it to 5g a day for the rest of their life. This means your initial box of creatine will run out faster than your other boxes. If you want, you could start off with 5g a day forever; you'll just reach the saturation point slower. It is upto you if you want to see some inital gains ue to loading quicker, or build it over time, possibly reaching saturation a month or so later. You'll be consuming it for the rest of your life anyways, so the choice is yours. Either way is good.

### 3. Preworkouts
Your reworkouts can be something you buy as a preworkout, or just some coffee. It all depends on what gets you going during the workout, be it a properly formulated preworkout or just caffeine. 

If you already get your daily caffeine from other sources and are worried about overdosing on caffeine, you can opt for stimulant free preworkouts.

Speaking of caffeine, do not consume a lot of it unless you really, REALLY want to stay awake. There was a time when I drank three cans of an energy drink (about 315mg of caffeine total), and I felt like absolute garbage. my body was tired, but my eyes wouldn't close and let me sleep. Just a personal experience.
