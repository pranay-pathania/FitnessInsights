### 1. Supplements
This is a BIG topic. And the one with the most confusion and/or misinformation. So it's time to clear some basics.

Do you NEED supplements to attain your goals? No. Do they make it easier for you to attain your goals? YES! 

Starting of with the most popular one, Whey Protein (or any protein powder, really). It is just your regular food sources in a powder form, which are high in protein and have little to no carbs or fats (in case of whey, it's milk). Protein powders are just a convenient way of increasing your protein consumption without any extra macros to mess you up, especially if you follow a particular dietary lifestyle like keto. That's it. It is not something magical you absolutely must have or else you'll never build muscle.

Continuing the whole protein powder topic, there's something to consider when making your own. If protein is not the highest in percentage by weight, it is not a protein powder. There's a lot of videos on social media that claim to make protein powders/protein shakes at home without the store-bought powder which typically includes a whole lot of dry fruits like almonds, cashew, etc. or a lot of bananas and peanut butter. Looking at their macros shows that they are higher in carbs or fats than in protein. Sure, you'll get the protein, but at the cost of a whole lot of extra calories - which may be great on a dirty bulk, but definitely not when you are on a cut or want to fine tune your calorie consumption.

### 2. Creatine
Another popular supplement is Creatine. Your body creates some of it's own creatine, and it is found in some foods, but the quatities are small and your muscles will not get to full saturation. Creatine helps with ATP production, which helps with upping your workout intensity; it hydrates your muscle cells and can be used by your body as a fuel source.

The most popular choice of creatine supplement is Creatine Monohydrate. It is well researched and has various proven benefits. There are many other variants, but they are relatively new, not researched enough, and used as a marketing gimmick more than something that's supposed to be better than monohydrate. Creatine Monohydrate is the cheapest and the most effective, hence giving the most bang for your buck.

Creatine is a saturation supplement. Some people prefer a loading phase, where they take about 20g per day for a week or so till their muscles reach complete saturation, then lower it to 5g a day for the rest of their life. This means your initial box of creatine will run out faster than your other boxes. If you want, you could start off with 5g a day forever; you'll just reach the saturation point slower. It is upto you if you want to see some inital gains ue to loading quicker, or build it over time, possibly reaching saturation a month or so later. You'll be consuming it for the rest of your life anyways, so the choice is yours. Either way is good.


### 3. Fish Oil
Fish Oil is one of the best ways to consume a fantastic source of Omega-3 Fatty Acids if you don't have easy access to eating fish like tuna or salmon. Even if you look past the availability of fish, Fish Oil is great as a Omega-3 FA source in general. It is popularly available as capsules, making it easy to consume.

There are some "claims" that comsuming Fish Oil (or egg yolks for that matter) with increase risk of cholestrol, but to be honest, as long as you have everything else in check, consumption of Fish Oil will not give you any harmful side effects. Though you may feel a fishy aftertaste, and from what the internet tells me, westerners hate the smell of fish.

Keeping aside muscle-building and fat loss goals, Omega-3 FA have cardiovascular benefits, and have shown some positive effects on patients with rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension, so why not take it.



### 4. Preworkouts,BCAAs,etc.
Your reworkouts can be something you buy as a preworkout, or just some coffee. It all depends on what gets you going during the workout, be it a properly formulated preworkout or just caffeine. 

If you already get your daily caffeine from other sources and are worried about overdosing on caffeine, you can opt for stimulant free preworkouts.

Speaking of caffeine, do not consume a lot of it unless you really, REALLY want to stay awake. There was a time when I drank three cans of an energy drink (about 315mg of caffeine total), and I felt like absolute garbage. my body was tired, but my eyes wouldn't close and let me sleep. Just a personal experience. 

As for BCAAs, if someone tells you that you absolutely NEED BCAAs for whatever goal, give them a smack and tell them they don't know what they are talking about. But in all seriousness, BCAAs are not really necessary. BCAAs are Branched-Chain Amino Acids, which are essential amino acids, i.e. the body cannot produce them and hence they must be consumed from outside sources. They are just 3 compared to a whole lot more essential amino acids you needs for muscle-building. Protein-rich foods already have enough BCAAs in them for your needs along wih all the other essential amino acids, so taking them as a seperate supplement is really unnecessary for a whole lot. Now, if a doctor has prescribed you BCAAs for whatever legitimate reason, that is different. As far as general fitness in the areas of muscle-building and fat loss is concerned, you absolutely do not need to spend your money on BCAA supplements as long as you are eating enough complete-protein sources.

There are a whole lot of supplements on the market, claiming to do XYZ better than another product. It is mostly up to you to look past the marketing gimmicks and choose the right products for you.

There are also many different supplements that are actually good and do what they do best, so choose them if their benefits align with your goals, of course while being aware of marketing nonsense and making sure to look up some studies both favoring and not favoring the supplement to broaden your understanding. You surely do not want to waste money on a pill box only to see no changes whatsoever.


### 5. Complete-proteins
I will be refering to food sources which are complete-protein sources as "Complete-proteins" for this text.

[1][https://www.webmd.com/diet/difference-between-complete-and-incomplete-proteins]

Complete protein sources are those which contain all 9 essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine). Incomplete protein sources are ones that do not. In other words, depending on these incomplete sources only is an unwise choice for your goals. 

Complete sources are the likes of fish, poultry, eggs, red meat, dairy and soy products. 

Incomplete sources are a variety of nuts and seeds (like almonds, cashews, walnuts, etc.), vegetables, and legumes (lentils, beans, peas, etc.)

As a vegetarian or vegan, your options are pretty limited as far as lean protein sources are concerned. Compare chicken breast and soya chunks for example. At 100g, chicken breast gives you 31g protein, 0g carbs and 3.6g fats at 165 kcal total. At 100g, soya chunks are 52g protein, 33g carbs, 0.3g fats at 345 kcal. While soya chunks give quite a bit more protein at the same weight, it is higher in calories and provides additional carbs, while chicken breast is mostly protein with a little bit of fat. If you are on a diet like keto, chicken breast is far superior. If you are on a "cut", chicken breast gives you a good bit of protein while keeping calories consumed lower. Choose as per your requirement. 

One thing to keep in mind is that I took soya chunks as it is one of the one really good contender for high quality vegetarian/vegan protein. Whole cow milk for example, is 3.4g protein, 4.6g carbs, and 3.6g fats at 63 kcal. Even if you consume the same amount of calories as in 100g chicken breast, you'll have consumed less protein than the chicken. Which one you choose, again, depends on your goal, and your financial budget too I suppose.

If you want, you can invest in a good plant protein supplement if you are vegan. For vegetarians, regular whey protein is fine as it is a milk product at the end of the day. Also, try to include multiple sources of protein if you have primarily consumed incomplete sources in the past (or still do).

### 6. Misconceptions
Misconceptions are a part of anything really, no matter that field, and fitness is no exception.

The first one is concerning for many men. It's that "soy products cause gynaecomastia (man boobs)". Now I, as someone who consumes soy products at least twice a week, can say that it is false. But I would be wrong in saying so, as my experience is not objective. We can always talk about whether soy products increase estrogen in men or not later, but here's my suggestion: experiment with yourself for a while. If you do see symptoms, discontinue use. This suggestion goes well for everything that does not include cyanide consumption. 

Another one people talk about is that "Lifting weights stunts growth" and they couldn't be more wrong. Although you can see where that thought comes from. Most successful bodybuilders are not over the magical measure of 6 feet. But the thing is, a shorter person will have an easier time filling out their frame. A taller person will have to put on more muscle to achieve the same ratios. Shorter people are more likely to achieve the bodybuilder physique (in a way) quicker. Just like how playing basketball will not increase your height, but a tall person is favorable for basketball. But the whole growth stunting thing is wrong. In fact, lifting weights promotes release of all sorts of the "good hormones" in your body, primarily Growth Hormone and Testosterone, which promote general body growth overall. However, if you do get a spinal injury from improper or ego lifting, you may lose you height a bit depending on the injury. But then, you should have removed some weight off of that bar rather than trying to impress your gym crush.

Here's more myths that you should know are trash and you should not fall for them: Women who lift weights will become the next Ronnie Coleman; You need to consume protein within a few hours after exercise otherwise you gains are gone; You need to consume raw liver and bull testicles to become super strong and jacked etc. All of these are what we call "broscience" and they are pretty good for comedic relief.

Remember to do some research thouroughly, from reputable sources, to gain in-depth knowledge (which means no articles on Facebook, learn to read scientific papers please). Also, make sure the research is not funded by a certain company that wants to push "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day" through its products. Being well-informed is a luxury these days.


### 7. PEDs
Performance-Enhancing Drugs (PEDs) are used a lot in bodybuilding, or any sport that requires top level of physical exertion. More so in bodybuilding, but it is not uncommon for athletes outside of bodybuilding using PEDs to improve their bodies artificially.
