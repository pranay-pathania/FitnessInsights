# FATLOSS

### 1. Introduction
we will explore the science-backed strategies, practical tips, and lifestyle changes that can help you effectively lose fat and transform your body. While the path to fat loss may seem daunting, understanding the principles behind it and adopting the right approach can make all the difference. Whether you're a beginner or someone who has tried various methods in the past, our goal is to provide you with valuable insights, debunk common myths, and equip you with the tools to create a sustainable fat loss plan tailored to your unique needs and goals. Get ready to unlock the "secrets" to successful fat loss and embark on a transformative journey towards a leaner, healthier you.

### 2. Fundamentals
Well, there's isn't much theory on fat loss. Just a couple basic topics here and there. What matters more is your mindset. For me, fat loss is what really pushes you to the extreme. In a world where everyone loves to bulk up and eat more and be stronger, going through the fat loss journey can be discouraging. Seeing yourself not lift the same weight you used to, feeling hungry a lot of the time, and other terrible sensations can be very discouraging. But the thing to remember is that these are a natural part of the fat loss journey, and you will recover your strength in the "post fat-loss phase".

With that in mind, we can discuss the fundamentals of fat loss. 

As far as nutrition is concerned, we follow the same principle of 0.8 - 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (1.76 to 2.20 g per kg). What we do differently is consume 200-300 calories BELOW maintainance. The jist of it is that you stay in a calorie deficit while consuming enough protein so as to minimise any weight lost as muscle due to said deficit.

Your training is going to be the same. However, you may add cardio to supplement your calorie deficit further. More on cardio later.

The recovery aspect remains same. See 'Recovery' in muscle building path for more details.

### 3. Nutrition
Taking from the Nutrition section in Muscle-building path, we keep the same protein consumption of 0.8 - 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (1.76 to 2.20 g per kg). Follow the same methods of calculating maintainance calories and subtract 200-300 kcal from it. That will be the daily calorie intake. As your weight goes down, so will the calorie consumption, assuming same activity levels. 

Something you need to do in order to make your nutrition life easier here is to consume less calorie dense foods. To give an example, 100g of raw blueberries gives you an approximate 57 calories. [1] [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/blueberries#nutrition], while just 30g of the brand of peanut butter I use is 183 calories. In this case, having the blueberries is much more filling and won't shoot you past your decided amount of calories. Consumption of protein rich foods is also helpful as protein keeps you feeling full for longer, and hence you have lesser chance to binge. Keeping full is the best way to fight hunger in a situation where you are already eating below what your body needs to maintain weight and you brain keeps pushing you to eat more.

That's all there is to the nutritional aspect of fat loss. Eat a cucumber or two with some lemon juice when you feel hungry and drink a lot of water and you'll do just fine. 

### 4. Cardio
There are many misconceptions regarding cardio and it's role in weight loss, and fitness in general. Let's discuss this in detail.

Cardio is basically exercise for the heart. It gets your heart pumping super fast, increases your rate of breathing to keep up with the oxygen demand of the body, and burns a lot of calories, way more than a weightlifting session of the same time period.

Cardio is good for your heart health, and comes with its own load of benefits fitness-wise. Is it necessary to do? No. But is it good for you? Absolutely. As IFBB Pro Greg Doucette says, at least 150 minutes of cardio per week is a good position to be in.

If you are unable to keep a calorie deficit, or want to eat at maintainance, addition of cardio will serve as additional calories burnt which will supplement your calorie deficit. 

Now that we have established doing cardio is great despite of feeling terrible afterwards, let's discuss what sort of cardio is good to do. We have to major choices - Low Intensity Steady State (LISS) and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).

LISS is where you continue a particular movement of low intensity for long periods of time. An example would be going on a walk or a jog for 30 minutes or an hour or more. 

HIIT is where you up the intensity of the exercise and go all out for a short period of time and then followed by low intensity work for a longer period of time, then continuing the cycle of high and low intensity without break. The low intensity work is your break in a way. An example would be doing a cycle of sprinting for 30 seconds and jogging/walking for 60 seconds.

For the general population, LISS is just fine. You don't have to do HIIT, which is better suited for professional athletes. If your goal is just fat loss, LISS is good enough and will not give you any less than HIIT. Infact, the general population might actually lose their gains due to overdoing HIIT, which may lead to an increase in the stress hormone Cortisol, causing more fat storage [2][https://news.yale.edu/2000/09/22/study-stress-may-cause-excess-abdominal-fat-otherwise-slender-women#:~:text=Cortisol%20affects%20fat%20distribution%20by,surrounding%20the%20organs%2Din%20animals.]. To be fair, any sort of overworking or less sleep will increase Cortisol levels; just something to keep in mind. In short, if you are not a professional athlete, stick to LISS.
